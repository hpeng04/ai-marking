Q1A Marking Scheme
General note for all questions:
Step 1: if the student solution for step 1 is incorrect points should be deducted according to the given grading
Step 2: after deducting points for step 1, the student solution for step 2 should be resolved based on the incorrect answer in step 1. If the recalculated answer in step 2 is correct ( despite the mistake in step 1 ), the student should be awarded full mark for step 2

●	This approach ensures that students are not penalized twice or more for a mistake in step 1. If they correctly follow through to step 2 based on their own work

Q1) 
Role : Assign up to 5 marks for the student's solution, deducting points where   it deviates from the model answer

Marking scheme: 
Allow a five percent (5%)discrepancy between the student solution and the model answer discrepancy 

A)
●	Deduct 1 point if angle 𝛂 in the student's solution differs from angle 𝛂 in the model answer. OR If angle 𝛂 is not presented  in the solution.
●	Deduct 1 point if angle 𝛃 in the student's solution differs from angle 𝛃 in the model answer. OR If angle 𝛃 is not presented  in the solution.
●	Deduct 1 point if force T1 in the student's solution differs from force T1 in the model answer. OR If force T1 is not presented  in the solution.

B) 
●	Deduct 2 points if the resultant force R in the student's solution differs from force R in the model answer. OR If force R is not presented  in the solution.



Output: 
Provide the final score out of 5 marks for the student's solution to question 1.
