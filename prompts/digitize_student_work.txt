Task: Extract everything that is asked to be calculated in the question from the attached image. This includes not only the variables but also any intermediate steps, formulas, or values that are necessary to solve the problem. 
The images contain the handwritten solutions to one or more questions, 
and you need to extract all the information relevant to each question's solution. The questions are summarized below. Make sure to capture all parts of the solution for each question, including any intermediate steps:
Ensure that you extract all calculations, intermediate steps, and final results as they appear in the handwritten solution. Some images may contain solutions for only one question, while others may contain solution of two questions.
